This is my theory homework

1.) Just use the strcat() function to concatenate two strings.
2.) The size of the array will be set to nothing. If you do not initialize a static array, a size will not be set until you set one for it.
3.) To declare a multdimensional array of size 64, you need to give the computer two pieces of data that multiply to thirty two. Example, int array[32][2]
4.) strcmp() compares two strings and sees if they are identical or not, and sees which string is bigger or smaller according to ascaa.

    fgets() essentially reads in a string that the user inputs.

    strcat() concatenates two strings, which basically means combining the two strings together

    strlen() finds the length of a string
